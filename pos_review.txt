How often do you see a movie like this? It absolutely rocks. Even though it tones down the violence of the dark horse comics, it seamlessly blends Tex Avery style wackiness into the real world. If that does'nt reflect the inner child in us and what everyone wants to be, then what does? Firstly, the main character is brilliant. Hes an explosive combination of all the wacky toons we all love. But the difference is that its all amplified 10 times over and its all real! You actually combine all this wackiness into a very serious, realistic, dark and gritty world. The guy who came up with the 'Tornado' routine needs to be given a major award. This has to be Jim Carrey's best performance in his career and for once, hes not overacting or being annoying. Cameron Diaz looks her best in this movie.
